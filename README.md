# Drumkit
The Drum Kit Web Application is a fun and interactive web project that allows users to play various drum sounds by clicking buttons or pressing corresponding keys on their keyboards. The application provides a virtual drum set with buttons representing different drum sounds, and users can trigger these sounds either by clicking on the buttons or by pressing the corresponding keys on their keyboards.

## Live Demo - https://rohitroy1711.github.io/Drumkit/

Key Features:

Interactive Drum Set: Users can interact with a virtual drum set displayed on the web page. Each drum sound is represented by a button with a corresponding letter displayed on it.

Sound Playback: When a user clicks on a drum button or presses the corresponding key on their keyboard, the application plays the associated drum sound.

Keyboard Support: The application supports keyboard input, allowing users to play drum sounds by pressing keys on their keyboards. Each drum sound is mapped to a specific key, making it intuitive for users to play.

Visual Feedback: When a drum button is clicked or a key is pressed, the corresponding button visually indicates that it has been activated by temporarily changing its appearance. This visual feedback enhances the user experience by providing immediate feedback on their interaction.

Technologies Used:

HTML5: For structuring the web page and defining the drum kit interface.
